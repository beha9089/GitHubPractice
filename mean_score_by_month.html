One small bottle of water upon arrival to double room feels a little poor. Would gladly have paid those 2\u20ac more per day to have 2 bottles initially and being refilled daily with room service. A couple of cents more, to have even tea on the small welcome tray ;-)\n- Bathroom floor gets completely wet when (carefully) showering, as only half a glass wall covers the shower. \n- Bed frame has very sharp/hard corners, and it's easy to get hurt. Apply baby safety corners?\n- Veranda door and main door doesn't close entirely tight so main door slams in the night when it's windy. However fixable in MacGyver way using the bed cover and a tea spoon, although a professional seal attached to the door frame would probably be a better fix long-term ;-)\n- Beach towel services would also have been nice and useful, to avoid using lots of space/weight in baggage.\nAll in all, this hotel is great but still has room for improvement in many little details which could easily be fixed.
